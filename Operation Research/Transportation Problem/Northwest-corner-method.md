# üöö Transportation Problem and Northwest Corner Method

## üìå Overview

The **Transportation Problem** is a special type of **Linear Programming** problem where the objective is to determine the **most cost-efficient way** to transport goods from multiple **sources** to multiple **destinations**, while satisfying supply and demand constraints.

---

## üßÆ Problem Setup

### Components:
- **Sources (Supply)**: Each origin point has a fixed supply.
- **Destinations (Demand)**: Each destination point has a fixed demand.
- **Cost Matrix**: Represents the cost of transporting goods from each source to each destination.

### Objective:
> **Minimize the total transportation cost** while meeting all supply and demand.

## üõ†Ô∏è Northwest Corner Method (NWCM)

The **Northwest Corner Method** is a heuristic technique to find an **initial feasible solution** for the transportation problem. It starts at the **top-left (northwest) corner** of the cost matrix.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
This method **does not guarantee the optimal solution**, but provides a valid starting point for further optimization (e.g., MODI or Stepping Stone Method).

## üìê Step-by-Step Guide

### Given:
|        | D1 | D2 | D3 | Supply |
|--------|----|----|----|--------|
| **S1** | 2  | 3  | 1  | 30     |
| **S2** | 5  | 4  | 2  | 40     |
| **S3** | 1  | 6  | 4  | 20     |
| **Demand** | 20 | 30 | 40 |        |

---

### Step 1: Start at Top-Left (S1-D1)
- Supply = 30, Demand = 20 ‚Üí Allocate **min(30, 20) = 20**
- Update: S1 = 10, D1 = 0 ‚Üí Move to next column (D2)

### Step 2: S1-D2
- Supply = 10, Demand = 30 ‚Üí Allocate **10**
- Update: S1 = 0, D2 = 20 ‚Üí Move to next row (S2)

### Step 3: S2-D2
- Supply = 40, Demand = 20 ‚Üí Allocate **20**
- Update: S2 = 20, D2 = 0 ‚Üí Move to next column (D3)

### Step 4: S2-D3
- Supply = 20, Demand = 40 ‚Üí Allocate **20**
- Update: S2 = 0, D3 = 20 ‚Üí Move to next row (S3)

### Step 5: S3-D3
- Supply = 20, Demand = 20 ‚Üí Allocate **20**
- Done. All supply and demand met.

### Important Rule
- In NWCM, you must fully exhaust the supply of one supplier (row) before moving to the next.
- This ensures that:
  - You go from left to right within a row until the supply is used up.
  - Only then do you move down to the next supplier.

## ‚úÖ Final Allocation Table

|        | D1 | D2 | D3 | Supply |
|--------|----|----|----|--------|
| **S1** | 20 | 10 |    | 0      |
| **S2** |    | 20 | 20 | 0      |
| **S3** |    |    | 20 | 0      |
| **Demand** | 0  | 0  | 0  |        |

## üí∞ Total Transportation Cost

Using the original cost matrix:

- S1-D1: 20 √ó 2 = 40  
- S1-D2: 10 √ó 3 = 30  
- S2-D2: 20 √ó 4 = 80  
- S2-D3: 20 √ó 2 = 40  
- S3-D3: 20 √ó 4 = 80  

### üîΩ **Total Cost = 270**
